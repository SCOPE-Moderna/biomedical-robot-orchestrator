    The Automated Plate Seal Remover calculates the amount of tape remaining on
    the supply spool by comparing the travel of the conveyor to the rotation of
    both the supply and take-up spools. After a completed ‘XPeel’ operation,
    this command can be issued to verify the amount of tape left as well as the
    space remaining on the take-up spool. These calculations are not perfectly
    accurate but they will provide sufficient warning to avoid running out of
    tape unexpectedly.
